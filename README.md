Healthlens is a food recommendation platform designed to help elderly individuals make healthier food choices. The platform provides meal suggestions based on the meals they upload, offering advice tailored to their nutritional needs.

### How to Use

Project Execution

Currently, the project is divided into three separate components:

Login System: Handles user authentication and access control.
Food Capture: Allows users to upload meal images or input meal details.
Nutritional Ingredient Analysis: This analyzes the uploaded meal to determine its nutritional content.
Next Steps: Microservices Implementation
Given the different technology stacks in use for each component, we plan to adopt a microservices architecture. This approach will allow these services to align and collaborate effectively, despite the diverse technologies being employed.
